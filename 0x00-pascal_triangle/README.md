# Pascal's Triangle

## Overview

This repository contains a solution for generating Pascal's Triangle up to a given number of rows. Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical construct in the shape of a triangular array of binomial coefficients, where each number is the sum of the two directly above it.

## Problem Statement

Given an integer `numRows`, generate the first `numRows` of Pascal's Triangle.

### Example

Input: `numRows = 5`

Output:
```
[
     [1],
    [1,1],
   [1,2,1],
  [1,3,3,1],
 [1,4,6,4,1]
]
```

## Implementation

The solution is implemented in python, and the main function for generating Pascal's Triangle is `generate(numRows)`.

### Example

To generate Pascal's Triangle for the first 5 rows:

```javascript
const result = generate(5);
console.log(result);
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is O(numRows^2), where numRows is the number of rows to generate in Pascal's Triangle.
