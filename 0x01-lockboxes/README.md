This Python script defines a function canUnlockAll that checks if all the boxes in a list of boxes can be unlocked, given that the first box (index 0) is unlocked. The boxes are represented as a list of lists, where each inner list contains the indices of the boxes that can be unlocked with the key in that box.

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

It initializes some variables, such as the total number of boxes n, a set seen_boxes to keep track of boxes that have been seen, and a set unseen_boxes to keep track of boxes that have not been seen but are reachable.

The function then enters a while loop that continues as long as there are unseen boxes. Inside the loop, it pops a box index (boxIdx) from the unseen_boxes set.

The function checks if the popped box index is valid (within the range of 0 to n-1). If not, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.

If the box index is valid and has not been seen before, it adds the indices of the boxes that can be unlocked with the key in the current box (boxes[boxIdx]) to the unseen_boxes set. It also adds the current box index to the seen_boxes set.

The loop continues until there are no more unseen boxes.

Finally, the function checks if the total number of boxes is equal to the number of seen boxes. If they are equal, it means all boxes can be unlocked, and the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
